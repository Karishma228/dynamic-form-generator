Project Requirements Survey App
This React-based application allows users to fill out a dynamic project requirements survey. The form schema is editable in JSON format, enabling customization of the form fields, options, and validation rules. The form can be previewed in real-time, and users can submit the form data, which is saved as a JSON file. Additionally, users can copy the form schema as JSON to the clipboard, making it easy to share or save for future use.

Features:
Dynamic Form Generation: Based on a configurable JSON schema, the form fields are dynamically generated, supporting different input types such as text, email, select, radio buttons, and textarea.
JSON Schema Editor: The form schema can be edited directly in a JSON editor, and changes are reflected in the form preview immediately.
Dark Mode: The application includes a dark mode toggle for a customizable user experience.
Submit as JSON: Form submissions are downloaded as a JSON file, making it easy to store or process the data programmatically.
Copy Form JSON: A button allows users to copy the form schema as JSON to the clipboard for sharing or saving.
How to Use:
Edit the form schema in the JSON editor.
Fill out the form preview on the right side of the screen.
Submit the form to download the data as a JSON file.
Use the "Copy Form JSON" button to copy the form schema to your clipboard.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
